The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you use `calc()` with percentages and the containing element's dimensions are not yet determined, the calculation might produce unexpected results.  This often happens when using `calc()` on an element that hasn't been rendered yet, or when the parent element's dimensions depend on the child element's dimensions (creating a circular dependency).
